Version 0.1: September 12, 2006
  - First release put on the SVN, with no real features.
  - Completely non-portable. Compiles in Cygwin for me, and that's
    all I care about for now.
  - Perft and the EPD suite testing are in separate modules. Decent
    perft speed, averaging 2.8-3.2 million nodes per second.
  - Extremely basic search implementation, with move ordering
    only at the root based on the results of iterative deepening.
    Basic hash table usage. No quiescence search.
  - Evaluation consists entirely of material, including the
    value scaling detailed in Larry Kaufmann's paper "The
    Evaluation of Material Imbalances in Chess." Nothing more.
  - Against an engine that essentially just makes random moves,
    Benthos is pretty good. Against anything that has the
    slightest idea how to play chess, Benthos is an abysmal
    failure. While it is consistently beating Eden 0.0.7, it is
		doing so in a manner that certainly doesn't reflect the fact
		that it can search quite literally 100 times faster than
		Eden...
  - 189/300 correct results on the Win At Chess EPD test suite,
    with 10 seconds per move. This seems pretty decent for how
    minimal the engine currently is.
